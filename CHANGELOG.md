## v3.11.0 — Timeline Housekeeping & Closure (March 2026)

**Release Date:** 2026-03-05

A deliberate, scoped housekeeping build that completes and formally closes the timeline module workstream. This release adds performance indexes and team permission enforcement while retiring timeline management features that are outside InDE's coaching scope.

### Added

- **MongoDB Compound Indexes (TD-015)**: Query performance indexes on `pursuit_milestones`, `temporal_events`, and `time_allocations` collections for sustained performance as data grows
- **Team Milestone Permissions (TD-014)**: Only pursuit creators can change milestone dates, types, or delete milestones in team pursuits
- **`created_by_user_id` Field**: New milestone field tracking who created each milestone; backfilled from pursuit ownership for existing records
- **`app/database/indexes.py`**: Centralized index management module, called at startup
- **`app/scaffolding/permissions.py`**: Milestone permission enforcement utilities
- **`GET /timeline/{id}/milestone-permissions`**: New endpoint for UI to check edit permissions

### Changed

- Milestone mutation API routes now enforce creator-only permission for structural changes in team pursuits
- Milestone extraction sets `created_by_user_id` from session context
- Timeline panel shows "Locked" indicator for non-creators in team pursuits
- Inconsistency resolution buttons hidden for non-creators

### Architecture

Timeline enhancement workstream formally closed. The timeline module (v3.9 extraction, v3.10 integrity, v3.11 housekeeping) is complete. The following TD items are retired:

| TD | Description | Retirement Rationale |
|----|-------------|---------------------|
| TD-003 | Missing Milestone Detection | Project scheduling, not coaching |
| TD-004 | Compression Risk Scoring | PM risk management, not coaching |
| TD-007 | Dependency Tracking | Critical path analysis out of scope |
| TD-008 | Timeline Branching/Scenarios | PM scenario planning out of scope |
| TD-009 | Calendar Sync | Stakeholder calendar mgmt out of scope |
| TD-010 | Evidence Collection | Compliance tooling out of scope |
| TD-011 | Scaffolding Modulation by Deadline | Calendar pressure corrupts coaching quality |
| TD-012 | RVE Trigger from Milestones | RVE already triggered by conversation |
| TD-013 | Estimation Accuracy Tracking | Performance management out of scope |
| TD-016 | Natural Language Milestone Updates | Ambiguity risk in coaching context |

**Principle**: InDE captures timeline information because it reveals innovator intent and commitment. InDE does not manage timelines.

## v3.7.4.4 - Integration, Polish & Gradio Retirement

**Release Date:** 2026-02-20

### Returning User Experience
- Context detection algorithm: resume pursuit, portfolio overview, welcome screen, expert minimal
- WelcomePage for zero-pursuit users with capability overview cards
- User API module for session state and preferences
- Context-aware routing after authentication

### Adaptive Complexity
- Four UI complexity tiers: guided, standard, streamlined, minimal
- Experience level auto-detection from innovator maturity model
- AdaptiveVisibility component for conditional rendering
- Complexity preferences stored in uiStore with auto-detect toggle

### Backend Cleanup
- **Pydantic v2 migration**: All `class Config` converted to `model_config = ConfigDict(...)`
- **datetime.utcnow() cleanup**: All instances replaced with `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`
- Zero Pydantic deprecation warnings
- Zero deprecated datetime calls

### Gradio Retirement
- Removed Gradio UI files: `chat_interface.py`, `auth_interface.py`, `portfolio_dashboard.py`, `v34_extensions.py`
- Kept `analytics_visualizations.py` (matplotlib-based, used by reports)
- Updated `run_inde.py` to FastAPI-only mode
- FastAPI serves React production build as static files
- Single frontend: React 18 with Vite
- Updated app/ui/__init__.py to export only visualization utilities

### Static File Serving
- React build served from `frontend/dist/` via FastAPI
- Catch-all route for client-side routing (React Router)
- API routes, WebSocket, and docs routes excluded from catch-all
- Development: Vite dev server on port 5173 with proxy to FastAPI

### v3.7.4 UI Overhaul Complete
The Gradio-to-React migration is finished. InDE is now served by a
professional React 18 frontend consuming the unchanged FastAPI backend.
Five sub-builds (v3.7.4.0 through v3.7.4.4) transformed InDE from a
prototyping UI into a production-grade Innovation Development Environment.

### Technical Notes
- Bundle size: 1,001 KB JS, 70 KB CSS
